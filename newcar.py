""" This Function:

1.  Empty Collections Initialization:
    nets: A list to hold neural networks corresponding to each genome.
    cars: A list to hold instances of the Car class that the neural networks control.
    
2.  Initializing PyGame and Display:
    The Pygame library is initialized, and a display window is created with the specified dimensions.

3.  Creating Neural Networks and Cars:
    For each genome passed into the run_simulation function:
    A neural network is created using the neat.nn.FeedForwardNetwork.create(g, config) method. The genome g and configuration config are used to create the network.
    The neural network is added to the nets list, and the genome's fitness is set to 0.
    A new instance of the Car class is created and added to the cars list.

4.  Clock and Font Settings:
    A PyGame clock is created to control the frame rate of the simulation.
    Different fonts are loaded for displaying information on the screen.

Updating the Generation Counter:

The current_generation global variable is incremented, indicating the current generation being simulated.
Main Simulation Loop:

The loop runs indefinitely, simulating the behavior of each car and updating the neural networks based on their actions.
Event Handling:

PyGame events are processed within the loop.
If the user closes the window or presses the escape key, the program exits.
Car Actions and Neural Network Activation:

For each car, the neural network is activated with the car's sensor data using nets[i].activate(car.get_data()).
The highest value in the output of the neural network determines the car's action: left, right, slow down, or speed up.
Updating Fitness and Car Movement:

For each alive car, the car's fitness is increased, and its position and movement are updated based on its action.
Checking Car Survival:

The number of cars that are still alive is counted.
If no cars are alive, the simulation loop is terminated.
Time Limit for Simulation:

A simple counter is used to roughly limit the duration of the simulation.
Drawing the Game Environment:

The game map is drawn on the screen.
For each alive car, its image is drawn on the screen.
Displaying Information:

Text information about the current generation, number of cars alive, and mean fitness is displayed on the screen.
Updating Display and Frame Rate:

The display is updated with the drawn elements.
The frame rate is controlled using the clock, ensuring a maximum of 60 frames per second.
